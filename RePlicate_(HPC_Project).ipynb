        "Observations and assumptions so far:\n",
        "1. Since an online plag checker would work on a cloud platform, we abandoned local testing in favour of a platform like Colab, as that would give results that are more realistic\n",
        "2. Major tests done include comparing the execution time taken by:\n",
        "  1. Serial implementation (for base time)\n",
        "  2. Multiprocessing library (for base data-parallelism time)\n",
        "  3. Numba library (for potential in-built optimum time)\n",
        "  4. If time permits, other libraries such as CUDA will be considered for implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Other libraries, such as iparallel are performing worse than expected, and worse than serial implementation, so they were left out of the final analysis\n",
        "4. Text files will be fed as input to the program (to be serially or manually converted beforehand since this project focusses of parallel plagiarism, detection, not conversion)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Final output will consist of two parts from the perspective of:\n",
        " 1. Product: Dataframe/spreadsheet type structure, showing level of plagiarism between files\n",
        " 2. Reasearch: A time-based comparison between the aforementioned methodologies.\n",
        "\n",
        " Original outcome expected data parallelism to perform better, but that is not the case, hence a black implemetation had to be adopted for successful completion.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Files are either in .pdf or .txt format\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementation:\n",
        "1. First part involves building the plag-checker and applying the various devised methodologies.\n",
        "2. The next step is building a PDF-to-text converter. The goal is to build a simple converter but if time permits, it will be implemented in parallel. \n",
        "3. The aim of the project is to create the first two modules. Future implementation will involve integrating the two modules together."
